\section{Data}

We evaluate the performance of the motif finding algorithms on a small set of real datasets, \texttt{hm03}, \texttt{yst04r} and \texttt{yst08r}. The first dataset, \texttt{hm03}, is derived from human genome, consisting of 10 sequences of 1500 bases. The other two datasets originate from yeast genome: the former, \texttt{yst04r}, containing 7 sequences of 1000 bases and the latter, \texttt{yst08r}, containing 11 sequences of 1000 bases. Thus, these datasets are composed of both mammalian and fungal samples, while containing different numbers of sequences. This allows us to assess the performance of the algorithms on a small yet diverse dataset.

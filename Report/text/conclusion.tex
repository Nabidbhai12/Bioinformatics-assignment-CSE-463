\section{Conclusion}

Since we used Hamming distance as our scoring function, this ended up causing a bias against larger motifs, as larger sequences are more prone to higher Hamming distances in general. Moreover, since MEME starts with a random initialization and changes multiple motifs per iteration, it generally takes longer to reach an optimal set of motifs, thus STREME usually has a faster runtime that MEME for all three datasets. Furthermore, improvements in STREME nakes it more tolerant towards noise and variations of sequence in motifs, making it a better choice for real-life datasets that are prone to error. Neither of our algorithms produced consistent results however, probably due to a smaller number of repetitions. Further study is required using larger datasets and different heuristic functions to provide a more comprehensive comparison of the algorithms and tools.

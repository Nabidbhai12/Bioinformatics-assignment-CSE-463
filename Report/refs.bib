    abstract = "{Sequence motif discovery algorithms can identify novel sequence patterns that perform biological functions in DNA, RNA and protein sequencesâ€”for example, the binding site motifs of DNA- and RNA-binding proteins.The STREME algorithm presented here advances the state-of-the-art in ab initio motif discovery in terms of both accuracy and versatility. Using in vivo DNA (ChIP-seq) and RNA (CLIP-seq) data, and validating motifs with reference motifs derived from in vitro data, we show that STREME is more accurate, sensitive and thorough than several widely used algorithms (DREME, HOMER, MEME, Peak-motifs) and two other representative algorithms (ProSampler and Weeder). STREME's capabilities include the ability to find motifs in datasets with hundreds of thousands of sequences, to find both short and long motifs (from 3 to 30 positions), to perform differential motif discovery in pairs of sequence datasets, and to find motifs in sequences over virtually any alphabet (DNA, RNA, protein and user-defined alphabets). Unlike most motif discovery algorithms, STREME reports a useful estimate of the statistical significance of each motif it discovers. STREME is easy to use individually via its web server or via the command line, and is completely integrated with the widely used MEME Suite of sequence analysis tools. The name STREME stands for 'Simple, Thorough, Rapid, Enriched Motif Elicitation'.The STREME web server and source code are provided freely for non-commercial use at http://meme-suite.org. Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}",

  author   = "Bailey, T L and Elkan, C",
  abstract = "The algorithm described in this paper discovers one or more
              motifs in a collection of DNA or protein sequences by using the
              technique of expectation maximization to fit a two-component
              finite mixture model to the set of sequences. Multiple motifs are
              found by fitting a mixture model to the data, probabilistically
              erasing the occurrences of the motif thus found, and repeating
              the process to find successive motifs. The algorithm requires
              only a set of unaligned sequences and a number specifying the
              width of the motifs as input. It returns a model of each motif
              and a threshold which together can be used as a Bayes-optimal
              classifier for searching for occurrences of the motif in other
              databases. The algorithm estimates how many times each motif
              occurs in each sequence in the dataset and outputs an alignment
              of the occurrences of the motif. The algorithm is capable of
              discovering several different motifs with differing numbers of
              occurrences in a single dataset.",
